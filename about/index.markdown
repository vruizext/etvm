Hello there! I'm Victor, an spanish expat living in Berlin for the last 5 years, even though traveling around the world now and then. I consider myself half software engineer, half data hacker, with some entrepreneurial plans in mind for the near future. I'm fluent with Java, Python, PHP, R. About my recent work, I spent the last years working for a startup in Berlin, where I was developing recommendation algorithms and learning by practice how to be a Data Scientist.
