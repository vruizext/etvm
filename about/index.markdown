Hello there! I'm Victor, an spanish expat living in Berlin for the last five years, even though traveling around the
 world now and then. I consider myself half software developer, half data hacker, fluent with Java, Python, PHP, R, HTML,
 CSS and Javascript.

   About my recent work, I spent the last years working for a startup in Berlin, where I was developing
 recommendation algorithms. Then I discovered that Data Mining was another of my passions, besides building great
 software. In the last months, after completing Coursera Data Science Specialization, I've been also
 learning a lot about Python scientific stack while having some fun with Kaggle competitions.
