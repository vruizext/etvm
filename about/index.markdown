Hello there! I'm Victor, an spanish expat living in Berlin for the last five years, even though traveling around the world now and then. I consider myself half software engineer, half data hacker, fluent with Java, Python, PHP, R and javascript. About my recent work, I spent the last years working for a startup in Berlin, where I was developing recommendation algorithms and learning by practice how to be a Data Scientist. In the last months, after completing Coursera Data Science Specialization, I've been also learning a lot about Python scientific stack while having some fun with Kaggle competitions.
