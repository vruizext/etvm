As you might have been noticed, I've built this blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
together with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) as blog engine. So far I think
it's a great tool, I spent only a few hours installing it on my laptop and customizing
the [Solar Theme](http://mattvh.github.io/solar-theme-jekyll/), et voil√†! I have finally
a blog engine which fits quite good to my needs and the best of all, open source software,
no database, no hosting costs and no dealing with the pain of customizing proprietary blog engines.
