Hello World!

I'm Victor and this is my second blog post ever, the first in this new project, which I've built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) together with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) as blog engine. So far I think it's a great tool, I spent only a few hours installing it on my laptop and customizing the [Solar Theme](http://mattvh.github.io/solar-theme-jekyll/), et voilÃ ! I have finally a blog engine which fits quite good to my needs and the best of all, open source software, no database, no hosting costs and no dealing with the pain of customizing proprietary blog engines.

I hope this is the start of a nice and long-lasting blogging story as opposed to my first attempt, which I started about five years ago before moving to Berlin, with the idea of writing about the experiences and adventures I was going to go through in that new stage of my life I was about to start. Sadly, that blog ended having only one post, I could never find simultaneously both enough motivation and free time to write and it simply sunk into oblivion.

This new blog has nothing to do with my first one as you might notice. Here I will be writing about some of the projects I've been working on during the last years and also about the new ones that are still to come. But still, there's something that links the two blogs, since I decided to name this as the old failed one. The title 'Ein teil von mir', which was inspired originally by the text of a [Berlin techno anthem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwQfDTkLmfA), means 'A part of me'. And that's the goal I had in mind when I decided to start both projects, sharing a part of me with the world.

Now a bit [about me](/etvm/about), I consider myself half software engineer, half data hacker. I spent the last years working for a startup in Berlin, where I was developing recommendation algorithms and learning by practice how to be a Data Scientist. In the last months, I've been learning a lot about Python scientific stack while having some fun with Kaggle competitions, and also struggling to find a remote job position or a long-term freelance contract --that is being not so fun though, I should write an article about--. At the same time I'm traveling through Asia with a group of about thirty people, enrolled in [Hacker Paradise](http://www.hackerparadise.org). Most of them are developers or software engineers like me, many others are also entrepreneurs creating their own products. It has been an awesome time with them, where I had the chance to learn new skills and also sharing mine with others. Definitely my best traveling experience ever.

I hope the knowledge I share here is helpful for some of you or at least you enjoy reading and learning some stuff. I am open to constructive critics and feedback, I will try to integrate disqus in the next weeks to provide a way of interaction with my readers. I will keep you informed about.
