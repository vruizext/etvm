Hello World!

I hope this is the start of a long lasting blogging adventure, where I will be writing about some of the projects I have worked on the last years and also about the new ones that are still to come. About the topics you can expect to find here, as you can read in the header, mostly Data Mining, Machine Learning, Python, R, but not limited to only this.

The title 'Ein teil von mir', which was inspired originally by the text of a [Berlin techno anthem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwQfDTkLmfA), means 'A part of me'. And that is exactly the goal I had in mind when I decided to start this blog, sharing a part of me with the world. I hope the knowledge I will share here is somehow helpful for some of you and also that many others of you enjoy reading and learning some stuff.

{% highlight python %}
def print_bye(str):
  print "See you soon %s!" % str

print_bye('World')
#=> prints 'See you soon World!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
