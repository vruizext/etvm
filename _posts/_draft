the first in this new project, which I've built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
together with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) as blog engine. So far I think
it's a great tool, I spent only a few hours installing it on my laptop and customizing
the [Solar Theme](http://mattvh.github.io/solar-theme-jekyll/), et voil√†! I have finally
a blog engine which fits quite good to my needs and the best of all, open source software,
no database, no hosting costs and no dealing with the pain of customizing proprietary blog engines.

I am open to constructive critics and feedback, I will try to integrate disqus in the next weeks
  to provide a way of interaction with my readers. I will keep you informed about.

I hope this is the start of a nice and long-lasting blogging story as opposed to my last attempt, which I started about five years ago before moving to Berlin. I had the idea of writing about the experiences and adventures I was going to go through in that new stage of my life that was about to start. Sadly, that blog ended having only one post, I could never find simultaneously both enough motivation and free time to write and it simply sunk into oblivion.
This new blog has nothing to do with my first one as you might notice. Here


At the same time I'm traveling through Asia with a group of about thirty people, enrolled in
[Hacker Paradise](http://www.hackerparadise.org). Most of them are developers or software engineers like me,
many others are also entrepreneurs creating their own products. It has been an awesome time with them,
where I had the chance to learn new skills and also sharing mine with others. Definitely my best traveling experience ever.
